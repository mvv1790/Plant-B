<h2>Bugs and changes</h2> 

  

Throughout this project I have encountered a few difficulties such as adjusting images to fit the screen, resizing font to fit smaller devices as well as numerous typos.  

  

The first iteration of the site was not quite clear. After some consideration I decided to lean towards the vegan food and not the positive impact of plant-based diet. Which is still a part of the website but recipes take priority, the positive impact is an added bonus.
