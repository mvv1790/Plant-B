<h2>Bugs and changes</h2> 

  

Throughout this project I have encountered a few difficulties such as adjusting images to fit the screen, resizing font to fit smaller devices as well as numerous typos.


In addition there have been a few attempts at adding animations to the site. Which had proven to be a bit of a challenge. 

A dropdown menu was considered but later dropped as it proved to be difficult to combine with other navigation elements.
  

The first iteration of the site was not quite clear. After some consideration I decided to lean towards the vegan food and not the positive impact of plant-based diet. Which is still a part of the website but recipes take priority, the positive impact is an added bonus.
